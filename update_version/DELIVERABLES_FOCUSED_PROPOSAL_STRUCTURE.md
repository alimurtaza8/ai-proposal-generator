# Enhanced Deliverables-Focused Proposal Structure

## Problem Solved
Previously, the proposal generator placed **pricing and deliverables** after technical specifications, which didn't align with business stakeholders' priorities. Clients need to understand **WHAT they get** and **HOW MUCH it costs** before diving into technical implementation details.

## New Business-First Proposal Structure

### ðŸŽ¯ **Prioritized Section Order**

1. **Executive Summary** - Overview with investment summary
2. **Understanding of Requirements** - RFP analysis with success criteria
3. **ðŸ”¥ Deliverables and Expected Outcomes** *(NEW PRIORITY)*
   - Primary Deliverables
   - Expected Business Outcomes
4. **ðŸ”¥ Pricing and Investment Structure** *(NEW PRIORITY)*
   - Investment Summary
   - Pricing Model
5. **Proposed Solution and Approach** *(After business value)*
6. **Technical Specifications** *(After business case)*
7. **Implementation Plan and Timeline**
8. **Team and Qualifications**
9. **Risk Management and Mitigation**
10. **Quality Assurance and Success Metrics**
11. **Support and Maintenance**
12. **Conclusion and Next Steps**
